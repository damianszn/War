# WAR

>Welcome on my WAR game repository. I started it as a _"vanilla"_ Javascript exercise (see the instructions below) and later on i used it >as a design exercise (using Bootstrap, a media query, favicon...).  

My name is Damian and i'm a junior webdeveloper at Becode.

It's my take at reproducing the classic "war" game played with regular cards.

I did the back-end part in + - 4 hours. A week later i did the design and it took me another 4-5 hours.
It's an exercise given by my Becode coaches.

## The instructions

This game of Bataille has only 10 cards going from 1 to 10.  
There is two players in the game (card game divided into two decks).  
At each turn, both players can pick a random card from their OWN card deck.  
The cards are discarded when played in the game.  
The game ends when there is no more card in the game.  
The winner is the one who won the most turns.  

Purpose of the exercise:  
Part 1: Pen and Paper  
On a piece of paper:

Use English or French to divide the game process into different steps.
Write in more details each steps using Pseudo Code, English or French (but no actual Code).
Read all the detailed steps again.  
Part 2:
Time to code ;)

Bonus:
Too easy ? Well this time rather than having 10 cards, you have an actual card game (four families of 13 cards).

Jack is 11
Queen is 12
King is 13
NB: What happen when both players play the same card ?

Have fun ;)
